## _National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)_ ##

Academically, there are a few Black student organizations on campus that also aim towards promoting Black excellence, with the biggest being the Idaho chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers. The NSBE has had much outreach in the community, notably contributing during their Keys to Success events and Dynamic Engineers Lecture Series in recent years.[^164] They also received national recognition during the 2014 40th annual NSBE convention, competing against 200 different chapters and earning the 2013-2014 Highest GPA Award, the Chapter Relief Award, and the Most Active Chapter of the Year Award.[^165]
