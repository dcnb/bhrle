# Ray "Thunder Ray" McDonald

*by Brody Gasper*

When reviewing Black history at the University of Idaho, there is difficulty in finding information regarding Black student organizations. Yet to say that it is difficult to find these histories, does not mean they do not exist. These histories can be seen in the students who attended the university and the faculty that worked here. Though they may just be individuals, their experiences shaped and highlighted what Black progress at the University of Idaho looked like. One such individual who has gone somewhat under the radar in his significance at the university is Ray McDonald, a fullback for the University of Idaho from 1963 to 1966.

Ray McDonald was born in Dallas, Texas on May 7, 1944, to Andrew Wilson and Bessie Mae Walker McDonald. He was raised in a segregated neighborhood, called McKinney, which had become one of the larger Black suburbs in Texas at the time. He spent quite a few years in McKinney until his family moved to Alamogordo, New Mexico at the age of fourteen. He attended his freshman and sophomore years of high school there until his family moved again, this time to Caldwell, Idaho.  Here, he attended Caldwell Idaho High School, becoming a three-sport star and the only Black player for the Caldwell Cougars. He set records in football, basketball, and track and field at Caldwell. McDonald was considered a rising star in the eyes of recruiters. McDonald was an All-American by the time of his graduation in 1963, and he stood at 6’ 2” and weighed 220 lbs, an impressive build which would prove beneficial for his time at the University of Idaho. In addition to his athletic career at Caldwell, McDonald participated in the school choir and played the piano.[^1] 

In 1963, after his graduation from Caldwell High School, McDonald enrolled at the University of Idaho and registered for the mandatory freshman football team. In the same year, his family also moved from Caldwell, Idaho to Lewiston, Idaho to be closer to their son. His freshman football year was a success, as McDonald helped lead the Vandals football team to victory over University of Washington (32-18) and Washington State University (36-0). His sophomore year of football was similar to his freshman year, although he missed his first three games due to an Achilles tendon tear he suffered after playing a game of pick-up basketball in the summer. This injury would play a major role throughout the rest of his football career that would come to impede his success. McDonald came to fame during his junior and senior years, where he led the Vandals to successful seasons and laid many records, some of which still stand today. It was during these years that he would be nicknamed “Thunder Ray” and be an All-American for the years 1965 and 1966.

During his collegiate career, McDonald rushed for 2,916 yards. Many of those came from his last year alone. He achieved 39 touchdowns and averaged at least 100 yards rushing per game. McDonald’s final game was a 255-yard game which still ranks fourth in the Idaho record book for most rushing yards in a single game. In his last season, McDonald averaged 132.9 yards per game – an unbroken school record to this day. He carried the ball 259 times, which ranks second in school history. On top of his incredible football performance, he was a Big Sky champion in the shot-put, a two-time Big Sky champion in the discus, and a two-time All American in track & field. McDonald also ran the 120-yard hurdles as a national hurdler for the Vandals track team and participated in the long jump.

McDonald's teammates from his years at UI had great things to say about him. One of McDonald’s teammates was Joe McCollum, a former Vandal wide receiver and friend during Ray McDonald’s early college years. About his friend and teammate, McCollum said, “He was a beautiful athlete, and on top of that, a beautiful person. There were very few Blacks up here at the time, but Idaho really embraced Ray.” [^2] Steve Burrato, a former Vandal offensive lineman and now a Canadian football coach, said that McDonald “..was more of a leader by example. He was such an extraordinary athlete he had the respect and admiration of everybody on the team.” [^3] Mike Monahan, a former quarterback for the Vandals football team, commented on McDonald's impressive performance despite his injury saying that “Ray never was able to truly show what he could’ve done because he limped the whole time he played, I don’t suspect the doctors back then did a very good job. He led the nation in running and he limped.” [^4] It was clear by his senior year at the University of Idaho, he earned the respect and admiration of his teammates.  

Riding his collegiate career success and his graduation in 1966, he was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the first round in 1967.  However, his professional football career within the NFL wasn’t as notable as his time with the Vandals. He was only able to play a few games in his first season, and one in his second due to his injured Achilles tendon. There was also the question of his sexuality which has led to speculations about his later departure from the team. While McDonald had not publicly come out as gay, many of his teammates assumed he was due to some incidents, including one incident where was he was arrested for having sex with a man in public in 1968. This led to aggravation from teammates and others. A.D. Whitman Jr., a former running back for the Washington Redskins said people would joke “...that he loved short yardage runs because he’d have hands all over him. He was just a nice, innocent kid. I felt sorry for him because they took advantage of him in certain situations.” [^5] Eventually, due to a variety of factors including his Achilles tendon injury, his experience of homophobia in the NFL, and a late appearance at a meeting with famed coach Vince Lombardi, McDonald was effectively out of the NFL in 1969. 

With his football career over, McDonald first returned to Texas, but ended up in Washington, D.C. to further his passion for music. McDonald was fond of gospel music and was a talented singer and pianist. He had majored in music during his time at the University of Idaho and even sang with the Vandaleers. By the late 1970s, he decided to enroll at the University of Washington D.C. and Howard University to continue his studies. After his further education at these universities, he became a music teacher at the Patricia Roberts Harris Educational Center in Washington D.C. (closed in 2009) and became the ‘Minister of Music’ at the Christ Holy Tabernacle in D.C. [^6]

However in 1986, tragedy struck. McDonald was stabbed by one of his former lovers, suffering a punctured lung. While in the hospital, he was notified that he had contracted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), during the larger HIV-AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s. He never notified his brothers about his sexuality, but eventually told his sister-in-law, Phyllis McDonald, who later said, “It was sad. He couldn’t be himself and be accepted. I think things would have been totally different for him if he could have been open. It would have been better for him and the family. He wouldn’t have had to move away.” [^7] After spending his recovery at home in Texas, McDonald moved back to Washington D.C., where he continued teaching music, while working on a doctorate. However, McDonald's health was deteriorating, and he would be in and out of the hospital. By his last hospitalization in the Parkland Dallas Hospital, he had lost around 80 pounds of his NFL play weight. He died on May 4, 1993, three days before his 49th birthday from an AIDS-related illness. 

Though McDonald’s story is brief and at the end, heartbreaking, his impact still lives on at the University of Idaho.
