The African American Read-In follows the noon opening of the inaugural Black History at the University of Idaho exhibit to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Black Student Union and Cultural Center. 

The UI Read-In's honorary first reader will be Mario Pile, director of the UI's new Black Student Center. 

Everyone is welcome to attend.
