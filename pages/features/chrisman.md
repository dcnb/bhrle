Edna Gertrude Chrisman was born on February 22, 1884, in Pennsylvania to Louis M. Chrisman and Lewis Edward Chrisman (the Chrisman family name is sometimes also spelled Crisemon). She, along with her parents and siblings (including Jennie Eva Hughes) moved to Idaho in the early pioneering days where her parent’s purchased tracks of land in the area sometime in the 1890s.[^1]  It is known that Hughes was enrolled at the University of Idaho starting around 1898, being the only child enrolled during this time. Edna Gertrude Chrisman’s first appearance within the University’s records is held within two key places.  The first is a picture within the Gem of the Mountains yearbook in 1903 where she is pictured in the University’s Mandolin club.[^2] 

The second is within the University’s Bulletin from 1898, which covers 1898 to 1903 and lists Chrisman as a second-year student within the preparatory school at the University of Idaho.[^3] For clarification, the preparatory school at the University of Idaho during the time acted as a high school, just operated through the University rather than a state-sponsored institution.  Most of the recorded history of Chrisman is from her time at the preparatory school, with more records of her being found within the same yearbook, being pictured in the Girls’ Glee Club[^4] and in the preparatory school class of 1903.[^5] She seemed to remain quite active within the preparatory school during the next year as well, being recorded in the Mandolin Club again with her instrument being noted as the guitar.[^6]  This is where her records more or less stop for a time in the preparatory school as well as her time at the University of Idaho, with the last mention of her name being noted in the 1908 Gem of the Mountains yearbook, wherein she was listed as a college freshman and living at 239 Almond St. in Moscow.[^7]  However, her stint at the University of Idaho as a college student seems to have been short lived as she left.  

After leaving the University of Idaho, she enrolled at the University of Puget Sound and graduated from its halls in 1910.[^8]  Interestingly enough, she had put herself in for a land drawing in the Coeur d’Alene/Spokane Indian River drawing in 1910 and had been selected as one of the winners. She purchased 160 acres of land that was estimated to be worth $5,000 at the time[^9] and homesteaded it for two years.  In a newspaper article written about her in connection to the purchase, it noted that she was a stenographer from Seattle, which would correlate with her attendance at Puget Sound and would also suggest that she had made a life for herself in the Seattle area.[^10]  Despite this, she left the Seattle area in 1910 and homesteaded her new land for two years, before she sold it and once again moved with her family to the Los Angeles area.[^11] 

Once she arrived in the Los Angeles area, she purchased an apartment building with the proceeds she had received from selling the land and once again, went back to school.  She attended the State Normal School in Los Angeles[^12], joining the Pi Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and eventually graduated in 1916, becoming a teacher.[^13]  She taught at the Brooker T. Washington school in El Centro, Imperial Valley, California and even became the principal of the school.[^14]  There also exists records that show she went back to school at the University of California to learn Spanish, a subject she would teach at Brooker T. Washington school. Apart from these last records, not much else seems to have written regarding her life. All that is known after this is that Edna Gertrude Chrisman died on May 28, 1966, in Los Angeles.
